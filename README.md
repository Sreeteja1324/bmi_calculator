BMI Calculator (Python GUI)
This is a simple and beginner-friendly BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator built using Python and its built-in Tkinter library. The application lets you enter your weight and height, calculates your BMI instantly, and provides personalized health suggestions based on your result. The interface is clean and easy to use, with colorful feedback and emoji icons to make it more engaging.

BMI (Body Mass Index) is a value derived from your weight and height and is used to categorize individuals into different weight ranges. The categories are: Underweight if BMI is less than 18.5, Normal weight if itâ€™s between 18.5 and 24.9, Overweight if itâ€™s between 25 and 29.9, and Obese if BMI is 30 or above.

This application offers a range of features: a graphical interface where you can input your data easily, real-time BMI calculation, color-coded result display with matching emojis, and a helpful set of health tips based on your BMI category. You donâ€™t need any coding knowledge to use the tool â€” just run it and input your numbers.

To run the program, first make sure that Python 3 is installed on your system. You can check by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing python --version. If Python is installed, you should see something like Python 3.10.5. Save the code in a file named app.py. Then, open your terminal, navigate to the folder where the file is saved, and run the following command:

nginx
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Or, if that doesnâ€™t work:

nginx
Copy
Edit
python3 app.py
A window will open where you can enter your weight and height to get your BMI and health tips.

This program requires Python 3.x and Tkinter, which usually comes pre-installed with Python. If youâ€™re using Linux and Tkinter is missing, you can install it using sudo apt-get install python3-tk.

For example, if your height is 1.75 meters and your weight is 70 kg, the program will show:

It will also provide tips on how to maintain your current health status.
